# Indeterminate Growth Assessment (Sex-Specific Adult Slopes)

Generated: 2025-12-31T12:58:31

## Summary

This analysis tests for indeterminate growth by examining adult height slopes.
Animals aged ≥ 120 months (10 years) are classified as adults.
A positive slope significantly different from zero (p < 0.05) suggests continued growth (indeterminate).

## Results Table

| wild | sex=F | 163 | 2.675 | 2.786 | 0.338 | 0.006 | not significant |
| wild | sex=M | 128 | 16.601 | 4.043 | 7.19e-05 | 0.118 | **SIGNIFICANT** ✓ |

## Detailed Interpretation

### WILD

**OVERALL** (n=291)

- Slope: 16.384 cm/year (± 2.769)
- p-value: 9.28e-09
- R²: 0.108

**SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE SLOPE** suggests **indeterminate growth** (continued height increase in adults at ~16.38 cm/year).

**SEX=F** (n=163)

- Slope: 2.675 cm/year (± 2.786)
- p-value: 0.338
- R²: 0.006

**No significant adult slope** suggests **determinate growth** (adults have reached final height).

**SEX=M** (n=128)

- Slope: 16.601 cm/year (± 4.043)
- p-value: 7.19e-05
- R²: 0.118

**SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE SLOPE** suggests **indeterminate growth** (continued height increase in adults at ~16.60 cm/year).

## Biological Interpretation

### Sex Differences in Wild Giraffes

**Important Finding**: Males show significant continued adult growth (16.60 cm/yr, p=7.19e-05), while females do not (2.67 cm/yr, p=0.338). This suggests **sex-specific indeterminate growth**, with males continuing to grow throughout adulthood.
